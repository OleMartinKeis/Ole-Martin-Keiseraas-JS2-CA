## JS Issues

Search function doesnt display the searched results, but gets them in the network tab. This was something that worked earlier, but I somehow managed to destroy and not find the solution to in time.

The delete button and edit button should only display when the creator of the post is logged in but only shows up on the first post in the post feed.

Can only delete posts from single post page

Can't update the profile

Can't display profile avatar or banner

## Styling issues

SocialGram/navbar overflow on smaller screens. I have not figured out how to use more of the whitespace on the page when using bootstrap. I could change it in scss but if I were too start changing bootstrap with scss then the bootstrap classes then bootstrap would become pointless?

Alot of whitespace on either side of the page, as mentioned above.


## What would I do different?

1. Ask for help from teachers earlier

2. I would not create a vertical navbar as it was very tricky to get to work correctly, I still don't have it as I want it.
